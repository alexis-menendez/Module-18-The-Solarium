# The Solarium

```md
⚠️ Work In Progress
This project is currently under active development and is not yet complete.
Expect bugs, missing features, and unpolished UI while construction is underway.
```

## **Description**
The Solarium is a themed book archive built with the MERN stack and Apollo Server. Search, save, and annotate your favorite works in a sunlit library of knowledge.

This app is still in progress and is being developed as part of an educational project. While many core backend and UI components are functioning, the application is not yet complete or production-ready.

Users will be able to:
* Search for books using the Google Books API
* Sign up for an account and log in with secure authentication
* Save books to their personal collection
* View and delete saved books from a personalized dashboard

## Future Development

While the core functionality is in place, several enhancements are planned to elevate both the user experience and visual design of The Solarium:

### UI/UX & Styling Goals

* Immersive "Sunlit Library" Theme: Implement a cohesive visual theme that evokes a warm, glowing reading room filled with sunlight and golden accents.
* Dynamic Book Cards: Add hover animations, soft drop shadows, and refined typography to each book result.
* Responsive Redesign: Create a fully mobile-optimized layout that adapts fluidly to phones, tablets, and desktop screens.
* Dark Mode: Provide a toggle for a moonlit version of the Solarium for nighttime browsing.
* Interactive Components: Refine modals, buttons, and forms to feel more elegant and responsive, including smooth transitions and subtle effects.
* Thematic Fonts and Colors: Customize typography with serif and handwritten-style fonts for a literary atmosphere, and incorporate a consistent color palette (warm yellows, cream, soft brown, and sky blue).

### Feature Enhancements

* Book Annotations: Allow users to add notes or reactions to saved books.
* Advanced Search Filters: Enable sorting by author, publication date, or category.
* Reading Goals & Stats: Let users track reading progress or set goals for how many books they want to explore.
* User Profiles & Social Features (stretch goal): Allow public profiles, book sharing, or curated booklists by users.
